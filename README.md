## **Methodology**

This codebase implements a **data-driven framework** for identifying and interpreting temporal regimes in multivariate environmental time series:

1. **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) clustering**  
   - Identifies distinct *temporal regimes* in multivariate datasets.

2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
   - Characterizes dominant modes of variability within each regime, and uses explained variances toward a "potential predictability" metric for each cluster.

3. **Information Theory (IT) metrics**  
   - Applied to PC projections to identify **dominant predictors** of CZ dynamics in each cluster, or for a dataset

## **Repository Structure**

### 📁 `DATA/`
- Contains processed datasets used in the analyses.
- The `Processed/` subfolder includes outputs generated by **DataPrep scripts** that assemble and harmonize original data files for each case study.

### 📁 `FIGS/`
- Analysis scripts automatically save generated figures to this folder.
- Example figures are included.
